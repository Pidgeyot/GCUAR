        This site was never completed and is a rough concept created for the GCU marketing department. 
        In concept, the site is able to display videos over recognized images that would be situated 
        around the campus. It can properly recognize an image and play video once a button is clicked. 
        However, the buttons do not display properly on mobile devices and the video does not display 
        properly on computer devices. I would recommend trying this site out with a mobile device. To 
        see the video, make sure the image given here is in view and a button should pop up. 
        It will partially be out of frame, but once clicked, a video will show over the spot 
        where the image is located. If the video is shaky, the closer you get the camera to the image, the more stable it will be!
